With your project open in the Unity editor:

    Open the editor settings window.
        Edit > Project Settings > Editor
    Make .meta files visible to avoid broken object references.
        Version Control / Mode: “Visible Meta Files”
    Use plain text serialization to avoid unresolvable merge conflicts.
        Asset Serialization / Mode: “Force Text”
    Save your changes.
        File > Save Project

This will affect the following lines in your editor settings file:

    ProjectSettings/EditorSettings.asset
        m_ExternalVersionControlSupport: Visible Meta Files
        m_SerializationMode: 2
